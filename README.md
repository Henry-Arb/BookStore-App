# Bookstore-App
Created for my final project in my COE 528 class and built to the specifications set by the professor.
I learned a lot from this class besides learning how to code an entire application. For example I learned that Java becomes really confusing when dealing with multiple different APIs that need to interact together (I literally lost like 50 braincells trying to get this app working on time ðŸ˜‚). 
I am sure that there are better / more efficient ways to achieve the same results, but as a first fully fleged app I am proud of it.
